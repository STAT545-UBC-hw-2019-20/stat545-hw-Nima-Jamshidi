## Exercise 1: Univariate Data Reshaping


### Univariate Option 1


**1. Make a tibble with one row per year, and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.**


```{r 1-1}
A1 <- gapminder %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = year,
              names_from = country,
              values_from = lifeExp)
DT::datatable(A1)
```




**2. Take advantage of this new data shape to scatterplot life expectancy for one country against that of another.**

Here the life expectancy of Canada is plotted against that of Australia.

```{r 1-2, fig.align='center'}
A1 %>% select(Canada,Australia) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(Canada,Australia))
```





**3. Re-lengthen the data.**

```{r 1-3}
A1 %>% pivot_longer(cols = c(-year),
                    names_to = "Country",
                    values_to = "lifeExp") %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```





## Exercise 2: Multivariate Data Reshaping


### Multivariate Option 1


**1. Make a tibble with one row per year, and columns for life expectancy and GDP per capita (or two other numeric variables) for two or more countries.**

```{r 2.1}
A2 <- gapminder %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols= c(year),
              names_from = country,
              names_sep = "_",
              values_from = c(lifeExp,gdpPercap))
DT::datatable(A2)
```

**2. Re-lengthen the data.**

```{r 2.2}
A2 %>% pivot_longer(cols = c(-year),
                    names_to = c(".value","country"),
                    names_sep = "_") %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```

## Exercise 3: Table Joins

```{r, include = FALSE}
guest <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/master/data/wedding/attend.csv")
email <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/master/data/wedding/emails.csv")
```

**1. For each guest in the guestlist (guest tibble), add a column for email address, which can be found in the email tibble.**

```{r 3-1}
guest %>% left_join(email %>% separate_rows(guest, sep = ", "), by = c("name"="guest")) %>% DT::datatable()
```

**2. Who do we have emails for, yet are not on the guestlist?**

```{r 3-2}
email %>% separate_rows(guest, sep = ", ") %>% anti_join(guest, by = c("guest"="name")) %>% DT::datatable()
```

**3. Make a guestlist that includes everyone we have emails for (in addition to those on the original guestlist).**

```{r 3-3}
guest %>% full_join(email %>% separate_rows(guest, sep = ", "), by = c("name"="guest")) %>% DT::datatable()
```
