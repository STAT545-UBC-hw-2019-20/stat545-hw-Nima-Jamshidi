Here is a summary of life expectancy, population and GDP per capita of
countries in Asia:

    ##     lifeExp           pop              gdpPercap     
    ##  Min.   :28.80   Min.   :1.204e+05   Min.   :   331  
    ##  1st Qu.:51.43   1st Qu.:3.844e+06   1st Qu.:  1057  
    ##  Median :61.79   Median :1.453e+07   Median :  2647  
    ##  Mean   :60.06   Mean   :7.704e+07   Mean   :  7902  
    ##  3rd Qu.:69.51   3rd Qu.:4.630e+07   3rd Qu.:  8549  
    ##  Max.   :82.60   Max.   :1.319e+09   Max.   :113523

Here you can see the summary of the same variables for Iran:

    ##     lifeExp           pop             gdpPercap    
    ##  Min.   :44.87   Min.   :17272000   Min.   : 3035  
    ##  1st Qu.:51.68   1st Qu.:25622000   1st Qu.: 5477  
    ##  Median :58.66   Median :39276715   Median : 7422  
    ##  Mean   :58.64   Mean   :42301707   Mean   : 7377  
    ##  3rd Qu.:66.32   3rd Qu.:61130476   3rd Qu.: 9334  
    ##  Max.   :70.96   Max.   :69453570   Max.   :11889

**Are life expectancy, population and GDP per capita of Iran higher than
the average of countries in Asia?**

As you can see from the above:

  - The average of life expectancy in Iran is less than the average of
    countries in Asia.

  - The average of population in Iran is less than the average of
    countries in Asia.

  - The average of GDP per capita in Iran is less than the average of
